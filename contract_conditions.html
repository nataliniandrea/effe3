              <b>1. Context of Application</b> <br />
              These General Conditions govern all supply relationships between
              the parties. Even in case of derogations agreed in writing, all
              parts of these conditions not specifically covered by the
              concessions shall continue to apply. Any general conditions of
              purchase issued by the Purchaser shall not be applied to
              relationships between the parties unless specifically accepted in
              writing by EFFETRE SRL, and in all cases shall not invalidate the
              efficacy of these General Conditions, with which they shall be
              coordinated. Placing of the order by the Purchaser shall imply the
              full acceptance of these general conditions of sale. <br />
              <br />
              <b>2. Duties and functions</b> <br />
              EFFETRE SRL's business is the design (conception and development)
              and then the production of products. Production activities may
              also be carried out in accordance with the design supplied by the
              Customer, which may be developed jointly. Even in this case,
              EFFETRE SRL shall fulfil the contract with complete technical and
              organisational independence, without any form of subordination, at
              the times and to the schedules it deems appropriate, with input
              from its own staff and, where it considers this appropriate, that
              of associates of its choice. Under no circumstances shall a
              contract of this kind constitute coordinated, continuative
              employment, since it shall be limited only to the fulfilment of
              the agreement governed by these general conditions. <br />
              <br />
              <b>3. Parties' obligations</b> <br />
              EFFETRE SRL shall perform the design activities in close contact
              with the executives assigned for this purpose by the Customer. All
              orders for supply of goods or materials relating to the
              realisation of the product shall be placed solely by EFFETRE SRL
              on the basis of the technical data and designs produced. <br />
              <br />
              <b>4. Design production times</b> <br />
              The times granted for the conception and development of the design
              ordered shall be agreed between the Parties on each occasion and
              correlated to the type of design ordered. They shall therefore be
              decided at the moment of assignment of the contract. <br />
              <br />
              <b>5. Fee for design work</b> <br />
              The fee for the design work shall be established in the quotation
              sent to the Customer, which shall agree to the relative amount at
              the moment of assignment of the contract. <br />
              <br />
              <b>6. Ownership of design documentation and non-disclosure</b>
              <br />
              All the design documents produced by EFFETRE SRL and consigned to
              the Customer company shall continue to be the sole, absolute
              property of EFFETRE SRL, which shall therefore be entitled to
              dispose of them at its own absolute discretion, as the single,
              exclusive holder of the intellectual property rights. The Customer
              shall be absolutely forbidden to disclose the data supplied by
              EFFETRE SRL with regard to the design, and all data, of any kind,
              relating to the business of EFFETRE SRL which come to the Customer
              company's knowledge in relation to this contract. The design data
              consigned to EFFETRE SRL shall be conserved with the greater
              possible confidentiality, as shall all the information relating to
              the work done for the Customer company. EFFETRE shall prevent the
              disclosure and/or publication of the material and documentation in
              its possession, except for relationships with parties strictly
              connected to the realisation of the design (mould
              producers-suppliers, etc.) and necessary for the preparation of
              the estimates and subsequent production; the non-disclosure
              obligation shall be extended to these parties. These regulations
              concerning the ownership and non-disclosure of the information
              and/or intellectual property in any way connected to the
              relationship between the Parties shall remain in force even after
              the expiry or termination of this relationship. <br />
              <br />
              <b>7. Production and supply</b> <br />
              of the product on an industrial scale – Production equipment The
              Customer's approval of the design produced by EFFETRE SRL shall
              lead to the award of an exclusive contract to EFFETRE SRL for the
              production of the product on an industrial scale, with an
              obligation on the Customer not to use competitor producers. The
              aforesaid exclusive right shall also apply to spare parts for the
              products. The Customer shall not offer for sale products with
              brand and/or appearance similar to those supplied by EFFETRE SRL.
              The Customer shall not modify, remove or delete the Brand or any
              distinguishing marks applied to the contract products, or modify
              their presentation. The supply quantities of the product shall be
              decided in the order for the same and the supply order shall be
              confirmed by EFFETRE SRL in writing. The same procedure shall be
              used to define the relationships between the Parties with regard
              to the materials, moulds or any equipment necessary for
              production, all of which may be supplied by the Customer. In this
              case, EFFETRE SRL shall allocate part of its store for the sole
              purpose of the production of the products on an industrial scale,
              and shall operate as a depositary agent as defined by law. EFFETRE
              SRL shall be bound by the relative obligation of safekeeping for a
              period of not more than 2 years from the date of the last
              production work carried out on the Customer's account. After this
              time has elapsed, the Customer shall be obliged, at its own
              expense, to collect the equipment in question or, as an
              alternative, to give orders for it to be scrapped; in this case,
              any revenues generated shall not be refunded. If nothing is heard
              from the Customer, once the aforesaid 2 years have elapsed,
              EFFETRE S.R.L. may proceed, at its own absolute discretion, to
              scrap the equipment (in which case the Customer shall have no
              claim against EFFETRE SRL) or, as an alternative, to request the
              Customer to pay a monthly storage charge. <br />
              <br />
              <b>8. Prices and payment for the items supplied</b> <br />
              Prices do not include VAT and always refer to goods ex-works -
              shipment always takes place on the Customer's behalf and at its
              risk; packaging and all other related costs shall be billed at
              cost price if not returned on specific request. All customs
              charges and/or taxes shall be payable by the purchaser. In the
              event that the product is offered for sale in Italy, it shall
              always be legally subject to VAT, regardless of the foreign
              nationality of the customer. Payment shall be made by the date
              stated in the order confirmation, by bank transfer or bank payment
              order. In the event of failure to make even part of the payment at
              the due dates agreed, EFFETRE SRL shall be entitled to suspend
              shipment of goods, if not yet completed, and demand payment for
              the items supplied, while retaining the right to claim for any
              further damages. In the event that EFFETRE SRL has authorised
              extended payment terms for the goods supplied and the Customer's
              legal-financial status appears to have changed, EFFETRE SRL
              reserves the right, at its own absolute discretion, to demand
              immediate payment for the items supplied, also pursuant to
              art.1186 of the Italian Civil Code. <br />
              <br />
              <b>9. Delivery</b> <br />
              Delivery terms are always guidelines and are calculated from the
              date of the order confirmation, unless the parties have agreed a
              precise term for delivery of the goods, in writing. The purchaser
              shall not be permitted to refuse deliveries, including partial
              deliveries. EFFETRE SRL does not accept any responsibility for
              inconvenience arising from circumstances of force majeure,
              accidents, explosions, fires, strikes and/or lock-outs,
              earthquakes, floods and other similar events which prevent
              fulfilment of all or some of the contract obligations at times
              that may be agreed in the contract. In this case the Customer
              shall not be entitled to cancel the purchase or request
              compensation. In the event of delay or interruption in fulfilment
              of the contract caused by the Customer, the latter shall pay all
              the additional expenses incurred, with the issue of partial
              invoices to request payment for the additional services and costs.
              15 days after notice that the products are at the Customer's
              disposal, EFFETRE SRL shall be entitled to issue the invoice and
              demand the relative payment. <br />
              <br />
              <b>10. Warranty</b> <br />
              EFFETRE SRL guarantees that the products supplied are free from
              faults and defects which render them unsuitable for the use for
              which they are specifically intended. The warranty against
              construction defects is limited only to faults in the products
              which can be traced to defects in the material used or design and
              construction problems which can be traced to EFFETRE SRL.
              Moreover, the warranty does not cover defects due to normal wear
              and tear of the products in the case of parts subject to rapid,
              continual wear. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the warranty
              shall be valid for 12 months from the date of delivery of the
              products. The aforesaid warranty shall apply on condition that the
              products have been correctly stored and used in accordance with
              the instructions in the technical documentation or design data
              supplied by EFFETRE SRL. The Customer shall automatically forfeit
              warranty cover in the event of failures caused by recklessness,
              negligence or carelessness during use of the products supplied,
              use of the product for purposes other than that required by
              contract, or tampering, modifications or changes, and if the
              defects reported have been caused by external agents. The Customer
              shall forfeit warranty cover if it does not permit all reasonable
              checks and inspections requested by EFFETRE SRL. The Customer
              shall inspect products to ensure that they conform to
              specifications and are free from defects within 8 days of
              delivery. The Customer shall report any obvious faults or defects
              in writing within no more than 8 days after delivery of the
              products; any concealed and/or operating defects shall be reported
              within 8 days of discovery of the defect and in all cases not
              after the end of the warranty period. In all cases, the warranty
              shall cease to apply 12 months after delivery. Complaints shall be
              submitted to EFFETRE SRL in writing, with a detailed description
              of the faults or nonconformities identified. The Customer shall
              not return products without the prior written agreement of EFFETRE
              SRL, and all returns shall comply with the procedures stated in
              the "Customer return form". Further to a properly submitted
              complaint by the Purchaser, if defects in the items supplied are
              confirmed, EFFETRE SRL may, at its own discretion: a) repair the
              faulty products, requesting the Customer to consign them to the
              EFFETRE SRL factory; b) supply the same type and quantity of
              products as those found to be faulty to the Customer's address, in
              which case it will request the return of the faulty products,
              which shall become its property. In the event that repairs and/or
              replacements requested on the premises of the Customer or third
              parties are covered by the warranty, with work performed with the
              assistance of EFFETRE SRL staff, no charge will be made for the
              labour or the materials used, but the non-working waiting and
              travelling hours of the technical staff and their travelling,
              board and lodging costs will be billed to the Customer, which
              shall be obliged to make the relative payment. In the event that
              the defects reported on the products are not the responsibility of
              EFFETRE SRL, the product repair and replacement expenses shall be
              calculated and billed to the Customer. The warranty contained in
              this article absorbs and replaces the legal warranty for defects
              and nonconformities and excludes all other possible liability on
              the part of EFFETRE SRL originating from the products supplied in
              any way; in particular, in the event that the defects are
              confirmed, the Customer shall not be permitted to submit any
              further claims for compensation and under no circumstances shall
              EFFETRE SRL be held responsible for indirect or consequential
              damages. In all cases, the responsibility of EFFETRE SRL shall be
              considered limited to the damage foreseeable at the time of
              signing of the contract, and under no circumstances shall it
              exceed the value of the goods supplied. For products which EFFETRE
              SRL purchases from third parties and applies to or installs on the
              goods supplied, the warranty shall be limited to the warranty
              provided by its supplier. <br />
              <br />
              <b>11. Retention of property rights</b> <br />
              Products are supplied with retention of property rights by EFFETRE
              SRL until full payment of the price, for the intents and purposes
              of art. 1523 of the Italian Civil Code, and all risks shall be
              borne by the Customer from the time of delivery. Therefore, until
              transfer of the property rights to the products, the Customer
              shall not sell or otherwise dispose of them without the consent of
              EFFETRE SRL. Failure to pay individual instalments amounting to at
              least one eighth of the total price may lead - at the absolute
              discretion of EFFETRE SRL and in combination with the provisions
              elsewhere in these general conditions - to termination of the
              supply contract, with the latter entitled to retain the price
              already collected as compensation, subject to any further damages
              due. <br />
              <br />
              <b>12. Miscellaneous</b> <br />
              Any derogations from the general or specific conditions shall only
              be valid if agreed in writing or confirmed by the vendor EFFETRE
              SRL <br />
              <br />
              <b>13. Competent law court and applicable law</b> <br />
              The Brescia law court shall have sole jurisdiction over any
              disputes arising from this contract, with no exceptions. The
              contract is governed by Italian law.
